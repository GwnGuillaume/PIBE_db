    Work Package 2 : experimental measurements
  </h2>

  <p>
    The measurement campaign allowed to record during more than 400 days :
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        more than 57 million sound levels and 100 ms acoustic spectra [6.3 Hz; 20kHz] for 5 points distributed between 350m and 1.3km around the wind farm following different propagation directions,
      </li>
      <li> associated 10min meteorological data: vertical profiles of wind speed and direction (11 heights from 10m to 185m), vertical profiles of temperature (4 heights, from 6m to 80m), wind (3 heights from 10m to 80m), sound speed,
      </li>
      <li>data related to the operation of wind turbines (electrical production, operating parameters of wind turbines ...).
      </li>
    </ul>
